To analyze the photos of river watercraft and differentiate between anglers and others using the meta data and image of the watercraft, you can follow these steps:

1. Collect and preprocess the data:
        * Collect a dataset of photos of river watercraft, including anglers and non-anglers.
        * Preprocess the data by resizing the images to a consistent size and converting them to grayscale.
2. Extract features from the images:
        * Use a feature extraction algorithm, such as SIFT or ORB, to extract features from the images. These features could include edges, corners, or other distinctive characteristics of the watercraft.
        * You can also use a deep learning model, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN), to extract features from the images.
3. Analyze the meta data:
        * Examine the meta data associated with each photo, such as the location, time of day, and weather conditions.
        * Use statistical methods, such as regression analysis or clustering, to identify patterns in the meta data that may be indicative of anglers or non-anglers.
4. Combine the image and meta data features:
        * Combine the features extracted from the images with the meta data to create a new dataset.
        * Use a machine learning algorithm, such as logistic regression or decision trees, to train a classifier to differentiate between anglers and non-anglers based on the combined features.
5. Evaluate the model:
        * Test the trained model on a separate dataset to evaluate its performance.
        * Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to assess the model's ability to correctly classify anglers and non-anglers.

To implement this approach in Python, you can use the following libraries and tools:

* OpenCV for image processing and feature extraction
* scikit-image for image processing and feature extraction
* scikit-learn for machine learning and statistical analysis
* TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning
* Jupyter Notebook for creating a document to present your results

Here is an example of how you could implement this approach in a Jupyter Notebook:
```
# Import necessary libraries
import cv2
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.feature_extraction import SIFT
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load the dataset of images and meta data
images = ...
meta_data = ...

# Preprocess the images
gray_images = [cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY) for image in images]
resized_images = [cv2.resize(image, (224, 224)) for image in gray_images]

# Extract features from the images
sift = SIFT()
features = [sift.detectAndCompute(image, None) for image in resized_images]

# Analyze the meta data
weather_conditions = ...
time_of_day = ...
location = ...

# Combine the image and meta data features
combined_features = np.concatenate((features, weather_conditions, time_of_day, location), axis=1)

# Train a classifier to differentiate between anglers and non-anglers
clf = LogisticRegression()
clf.fit(combined_features, meta_data['angler'])

# Evaluate the model
test_features = ...
test_meta_data = ...
test_pred = clf.predict(test_features)
accuracy = accuracy_score(test_meta_data['angler'], test_pred)
print('Accuracy:', accuracy)
```
This is just an example, and you may need to modify it depending on the specifics of your dataset and the requirements of your project.

To analyze the photos of river watercraft using the meta data and image, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries:
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.feature_extraction.image import ImageCollection
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from sklearn.externals import joblib
from IPython.display import display
```
2. Load the photos from GitHub:
```python
# Load the photos from GitHub
photos = pd.read_csv("https://github.com/<username>/<repo>/photos.csv")
```
3. Extract the meta data from the photos:
```python
# Extract the meta data from the photos
meta_data = photos[["photo_id", "date_taken", "location", "weather", "time_of_day"]]
```
4. Preprocess the image data:
```python
# Preprocess the image data
image_data = photos[["image_data"]]
image_data = image_data.apply(lambda x: x.astype("float32"))
image_data = image_data.apply(lambda x: x / 255)
```
5. Create a pipeline to extract features from the images:
```python
# Create a pipeline to extract features from the images
image_pipeline = Pipeline([
    ("scaler", StandardScaler()),
    ("extractor", ImageCollection(n_jobs=-1)),
    ("selector", ColumnTransformer(transformers=[
        ("pca", PCA(n_components=100), ["image_data"])
    ]))
])
```
6. Fit the pipeline to the image data:
```python
# Fit the pipeline to the image data
image_pipeline.fit(image_data)
```
7. Extract the features from the images:
```python
# Extract the features from the images
image_features = image_pipeline.transform(image_data)
```
8. Combine the image features with the meta data:
```python
# Combine the image features with the meta data
combined_data = pd.concat([image_features, meta_data], axis=1)
```
9. Split the data into training and testing sets:
```python
# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(combined_data.drop("angler", axis=1), combined_data["angler"], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```
10. Train a logistic regression model on the training data:
```python
# Train a logistic regression model on the training data
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```
11. Evaluate the model on the testing data:
```python
# Evaluate the model on the testing data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
```
12. Save the model to a file:
```python
# Save the model to a file
joblib.dump(model, "angler_model.pkl")
```
13. Load the model from the file:
```python
# Load the model from the file
model = joblib.load("angler_model.pkl")
```
14. Use the model to predict the angler status for new photos:
```python
# Use the model to predict the angler status for new photos
new_photos = pd.DataFrame({"image_data": [...], "meta_data": [...])
new_photos = image_pipeline.transform(new_photos)
new_photos = pd.concat([new_photos, meta_data], axis=1)
new_photos = new_photos.drop("angler", axis=1)
new_photos["angler"] = model.predict(new_photos)
```
You can then use the `new_photos` DataFrame to display the predicted angler status for the new photos.

Note: This is just an example, and you may need to modify it depending on the specifics of your dataset and the requirements of your project.

code to create the csv file from the meta data found in the photos
To create a CSV file from the metadata found in the photos, you can use the `exiftool` command-line tool. Here's an example of how to do this:
```
exiftool -csv -r /path/to/photos > output.csv
```
This command will recursively scan the `/path/to/photos` directory and its subdirectories for photos, and extract the metadata for each photo into a CSV file called `output.csv`. The `-csv` option tells `exiftool` to output the metadata in CSV format, and the `-r` option tells it to recurse into subdirectories.

You can customize the output by specifying additional options. For example, to include only the file name, date, and time in the output, you can use the following command:
```
exiftool -csv -r -filename -date -time /path/to/photos > output.csv
```
This will output a CSV file with three columns: the file name, the date, and the time.

You can also use other options to customize the output further. For example, you can use the `-d` option to specify the delimiter character used in the output, or the `-e` option to specify the encoding of the output. For more information, see the `exiftool` documentation.
